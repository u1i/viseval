I've maintained those rounded values in the CSV.\n*   **Data Years:** The infographic mentions \"2023\" for GDP and \"2025\" for population.  I've used these as the implied years for those data points. Education and Military spending data years vary (see footnote in the image).\n*   **\"Southeast Asia\" Total:** The infographic gives a total GDP of $28 trillion and a total population of 615 million. These totals are *not* included in the CSV, as it focuses on individual countries.\n*   **Ambiguity:** Some values are very close together in the infographic, making it slightly difficult to read them precisely. I've done my best to interpret them correctly.\n*   **Timor-Leste Note:** The footnote states \"Timor-Leste's figure is from 2021.\"\n*   **Military Spending Note:** The footnote states \"Military spending: Laos's figure is from 2018, and Vietnam's from 2022.\"\n*   **Education Spending Note:** The footnote states \"Education spending: Brunei's figure is from 2016, Myanmar from 2019.\"\n\n**How to Use This CSV:**\n\n1.  **Copy the text:** Select all the text in the code block above (including the header row).\n2.  **Paste into a text editor:** Open a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac - make sure to save as plain text).\n3.  **Save as a .csv file:** Save the file with a `.csv` extension (e.g., `southeast_asia_data.csv`).\n4.  **Open in a spreadsheet program:** You can now open the `.csv` file in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc. The data should be automatically separated into columns.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need any adjustments to this CSV!\n"
