This CSV reflects those approximations.\n*   **Missing Data:** If any data points were truly unreadable or missing from the infographic, they are not included.\n\nTo use this CSV, you can save it as a `.csv` file (e.g., `southeast_asia_data.csv`) and open it with spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or import it into a data analysis tool like Python (with Pandas).\n"
