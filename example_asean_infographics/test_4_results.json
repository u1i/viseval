I've done my best to interpret the visual representations accurately.  There's always a chance of misinterpretation.\n*   **Rounding:** I've rounded numbers to the nearest whole dollar.\n*   **\"By The Numbers\"**: The infographic's title suggests a focus on percentages and ratios.  I've included those as requested.\n*   **Timor-Leste/East Timor:**  I've used \"Timor-Leste\" as the country name.\n*   **Population:** The population numbers are stated as \"M\" (millions) and \"K\" (thousands), which I converted accordingly.\n*   **Military Spending:** The footnote indicates that military spending figures are from 2021 for Vietnam and 2022 for Brunei.\n*   **Education Spending:** The footnote indicates that education spending figures are from 2019 for Myanmar.\n*   **Accuracy:**  This data is based *solely* on the information presented in the infographic.  It should not be considered a definitive or authoritative source.  Always cross-reference with reliable data sources for critical decisions.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot guarantee the complete accuracy of this data.
